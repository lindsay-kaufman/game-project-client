# Tic Tac Toe

# Planning Story
In planning this application, I first created some basic wireframes and wrote multiple user stories (below). Next, I wrote down my list of requirements to complete this project and created a schedule to ensure I finished each requirement by the due date.

# User Stories

- As a logged out user, I would like to be able to sign up with email, password, and password confirmation.
- As a logged out user, I would like to be able to sign in with email and password.
- As a logged in user, I would like to be able to change my password.
- As a logged in user, I would like to be able to start a new game of Tic Tac Toe.
- As a logged in user, I would like to be able to view my game count of completed games.
- As a logged in user, I would like to be able to view my completed game boards.
- As a logged in user, I would like to be able to log out.
